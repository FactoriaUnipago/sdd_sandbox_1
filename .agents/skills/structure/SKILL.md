# Structure Conventions — SDD

## Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Files/Folders | kebab-case | `user-service.ts` |
| React Components | PascalCase | `UserProfile.tsx` |
| Tests | suffix/prefix | `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `test_*.py` |

## SDD Artifacts (all project types)

`specs/` (per-feature) · `docs/` (generated) · `product.md` (context) · `.sdd-config.json` (config, git-tracked). See `artifact-storage.md`.

## Project Type (`project_type`)

| Type | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| `new` | Greenfield | Scaffold `app/` with full structure |
| `existing` | In production | Add artifacts around code. NEVER move code |
| `migration` | Rewriting | Like `existing` + migration-plan.md |

## Repo Type (`repo_type`)

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `single` | One project in `app/` — includes fullstack (`app/server/` + `app/client/`) | Task Manager with Express + React |
| `monorepo` | Multiple **independent** apps/packages: `packages/` or `apps/` with workspace manager (pnpm, turborepo, nx) | Platform with `packages/api/`, `packages/web/`, `packages/mobile/`, `packages/shared/` |
| `multirepo` | Independent SDD per repo | Separate repos for API and frontend |

> ⚠️ A fullstack app with `server/` + `client/` inside `app/` is **`single`**, NOT `monorepo`. Monorepo means multiple independently deployable packages managed by a workspace tool.

## Structures by Combination

### `new` + `single`

```
project/
├── .agents/ .agents/
├── specs/{feature}/ (requirements.md, design.md, test-plan.md)
├── docs/ (architecture/, api/)
├── app/
│   ├── src/ (routes/ services/ repositories/ models/ middleware/ config/)
│   ├── tests/ (unit/ integration/ e2e/)
│   ├── package.json, tsconfig.json
├── db/migrations/
├── infra/lib/
├── vercel.json              # Configuración de proyecto Vercel (solo si deployment.app incluye Vercel). Generado por pipeline-builder.
├── product.md, .sdd-config.json, sdd-sync.sh
```

> **Why `app/`?** Separates SDD artifacts from code; simplifies .gitignore/CI/Docker; eases monorepo migration.

### `existing` + `single`

```
project/
├── .agents/ .agents/
├── specs/, docs/
├── {project-name}/      ← existing code (cloned from git remote or placed by user)
├── app/                 ← NEW features/code go here
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
├── product.md, .sdd-config.json, sdd-sync.sh
```

> **Setup**: Ask user for the git remote URL of the existing project → clone into a named folder (e.g., `git clone <url> {project-name}/`). Alternatively, user places it manually. Existing code is **read-only reference** — never modified by SDD. New features go in `app/`.

### `migration` + `single`

```
project/
├── .agents/ .agents/
├── specs/ (migration-plan.md, {feature}/)
├── docs/architecture/migration-map.md
├── {legacy-name}/       ← legacy code (cloned from git remote or placed by user)
├── app/                 ← NEW migrated code (same structure as 'new')
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
├── product.md, .sdd-config.json, sdd-sync.sh
```

> **Setup**: Same as `existing` — ask for git remote, clone into folder. Legacy code is **read-only reference** for analysis. New migrated code goes in `app/`. Legacy folder removed when migration is complete.

### `new` + `monorepo`

```
project/
├── specs/              # by FEATURE (cross-package)
├── packages/
│   ├── api/ web/ mobile/ shared/  (each: src/ tests/ package.json)
├── infra/lib/, db/migrations/
├── package.json (root workspaces), pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── product.md, sdd-sync.sh
```

> Specs per-feature, not per-package. Detection: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `workspaces` in package.json, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, `turbo.json`.

### `existing` + `monorepo`

Same as `existing` + `single`: add artifacts, don't restructure.

### `multirepo`

Apply `single` pattern to each repo independently. `{prefix}ID` coordinates cross-repo features. Shared contracts via OpenAPI/published packages.

### Multi-IDE Support

IDE config dirs are gitignored. `sdd-sync.sh --ide kiro` syncs to `.agents/` only. Config: `.sdd-config.json` → `ides: ["kiro", "cursor", "windsurf"]`.

---

## Deploy Ignore

SDD artifacts NEVER deployed. Each deployable app needs ignore file:

```
specs/ tests/ docs/ db/ .agents/ .cursor/ .windsurf/ .github/copilot/ .sdd-* sdd-sync.sh *.md !README.md
```

---

## Mono vs Multi Decision

| Factor | Monorepo | Multirepo |
|--------|:--------:|:---------:|
| 1 team, shared code | ✅ | — |
| Independent teams | — | ✅ |
| Separate deploys | Both | ✅ natural |
| Onboarding | 1 clone | N clones |
| CI/CD | Path filters | Simple |

---

## Code Structure by Stack

**TypeScript/Node**: `src/` → routes, services, repositories, models, utils, middleware, config · `tests/` → unit, integration, e2e

**Python/FastAPI**: `app/` → routes, services, repositories, models, schemas, utils, config · `tests/` → unit, integration

---

## Rules

1. The IDE config directories (`.agents/`, `.agents/`, etc.) are NOT manually modified — managed by sync
2. SDD NEVER moves or restructures existing code — it adds artifacts around it
3. In monorepos, specs are organized by **feature**, not by package
4. `app/` is the code root for ALL project types — repo root is SDD-only territory
5. For `existing`/`migration`: existing code goes in its own named folder (cloned or placed by user). New code goes in `app/`. NEVER create project files at repo root
6. NEVER mix specs from different apps in the same `specs/{prefix}[ID]/` folder
7. ALWAYS use {prefix}ID for cross-repo traceability in multirepo
8. ALWAYS each deployable app has its own ignore file
9. NEVER deploy specs/, tests/, docs/, .[ide]/, .sdd-*
10. In monorepo, cross-app features use ONE spec with separate tasks per app
